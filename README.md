# DevOps Learning Journal

## 📖 About

Documenting my weekly progress while learning DevOps concepts and practical labs via KodeKloud.

This repository contains my personal notes, lab summaries, and hands-on exercises based on lectures and labs from **[KodeKloud](https://kodekloud.com)** and related resources.

## 🎯 Goal

My goal is to build a strong foundation in DevOps by practicing real-world scenarios, including:

- Linux fundamentals (CLI commands, file and service management)
- Networking basics and configurations
- Package managers (YUM, RPM, pip, npm)
- Service and process management (systemd, custom service files)
- Git workflows and version control
- Build tools (Maven, Gradle, Ant)
- Scripting with Python, Java, and Node.js for automation
